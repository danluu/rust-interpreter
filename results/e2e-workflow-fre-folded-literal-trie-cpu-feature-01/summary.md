# Production edits and existing fre tests

All eighteen original folded-literal-trie tests, including complete short-byte-string/window differentials, malformed UTF-8, canonical folding, exact resource gates, SIMD prefilters and accounting.

5 cumulative production-body refactors; test source is unchanged. Every mode first rejected a wrong production edit. Full subprocess time includes Cargo, launcher, compilation, and execution. Native runs the selected tests in one command. Custom engines use one command.

Unavailable foreign calls and catch_unwind intrinsics are explicit terminal stops. Successful tests avoided those boundaries; their call-site metadata and exact executed bytecode are retained with the command records. Ordinary type and borrow checking remained enabled.

Custom-engine Cargo commands explicitly set `RUSTFLAGS=-Zmir-opt-level=3`. Native retains its Cargo development/test profile. Frontend and overflow checks remain enabled. Without an explicit Cargo target these flags can also affect host build tools; exact flags are retained in the command records.

| Mode | Median edited workflow seconds | Cold workflow seconds |
|---|---:|---:|
| native | 1.768 | 7.480 |
| interpreter | 21.619 | 25.965 |
| jit | 3.941 | 7.979 |

Cold means empty per-engine artifact caches; tool bootstrap, installed sysroot, downloads, and OS file-cache coldness are excluded. Five samples on a shared host are not a confidence interval or a whole-suite result.

Custom engines use the shared metadata-only standard library. Its original installation took 10.997 s, including 9.185 s of metadata compilation; that setup is excluded from the command times above. Native uses the installed standard library.
