# Production edits and existing nushell tests

Seven existing fractional, decreasing, and rounded floating-point range tests.

5 cumulative production-body refactors; test source is unchanged. Every mode first rejected a wrong production edit. Full subprocess time includes Cargo, launcher, compilation, and execution. Native runs the selected tests in one command. Custom engines use one command.

| Mode | Median edited workflow seconds | Cold workflow seconds |
|---|---:|---:|
| native | 7.438 | 66.067 |
| interpreter | 5.173 | 62.072 |
| jit | 5.087 | 66.429 |

Cold means empty per-engine artifact caches; tool bootstrap, installed sysroot, downloads, and OS file-cache coldness are excluded. Five samples on a shared host are not a confidence interval or a whole-suite result.

Custom engines use the shared metadata-only standard library. Its original installation took 10.997 s, including 9.185 s of metadata compilation; that setup is excluded from the command times above. Native uses the installed standard library.
