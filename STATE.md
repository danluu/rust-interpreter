# Current state — September 11, 2026

The unbounded goal remains active: improve the custom Rust development engine
using real source-edit/build/test benchmarks. Every item in `suggestions.txt`
has an [explicit decision](docs/SUGGESTIONS-REVIEW-20260910.md); that user-owned
file remains unchanged and untracked. Local commits are authorized; no push.
Branch: `experiment/resumable-native-calls`.

## Current experiment

The isolated aggregate-frame relocation exporter is tool `9637b0ac`, built from
the current `0e94d6d8` source with [tracked injection recipes](benchmarks/experiments/aggregate-byte-writes/build_relocation.py).
It reuses storage for nonoverlapping MIR locals with emitted-byte write proofs,
normal-return edge handling, named origins, and checked ABI/scratch relocation.
All VM initialization remains. VM and wrapper binaries are unchanged.
The production compiler has not adopted this experiment.

Its [primary comparison](results/aggregate-relocation-e2e-01/assessment.md)
passes both predeclared gates (168 commands, 30 edited pairs, 84 artifacts):

| Case | Paired wall | Paired CPU | Native median | Control | Candidate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Folded trie | −12.77% | −12.89% | 1.702s | 1.939s | 1.696s |
| Token phrase | +3.70% | +3.33% | 1.965s | 4.290s | 4.462s |

The candidate passes [39 compiler tests](results/aggregate-relocation-build-01/summary.json),
[1,024 differential VM executions](results/aggregate-relocation-fixtures-01/summary.json),
[47,004 broad validation commands](results/aggregate-relocation-native-01/assessment.md),
[245 TLS/destructor commands](results/aggregate-relocation-tls-01/assessment.md), and
[382 fre bodies, seven ignored, with fresh native controls](results/aggregate-relocation-fre-01/assessment.md).
Original assertions and strict type/borrow rejections remain.

All [seven held-outs](results/aggregate-relocation-heldout-recovery-01/assessment.md)
now pass their separate 5% wall/CPU guards: 588 commands, 105 edited pairs and
294 artifact hashes verify. Paired wall changes range from −0.28% to +2.71%;
CPU changes from −0.27% to +2.21%. Native/control/candidate absolute times are
reported separately; no pooled speedup. Private output is aggregate-only.
The original Ruff stop remains preserved and its five partial pairs excluded.

Recorded [capture/finalization costs](results/aggregate-relocation-pass-costs-01/assessment.md)
are 41.9 ms folded and 189.5 ms token. Token execution saves only 79.3 ms paired,
against 237.4 ms more Cargo time. These are completed-run observations, with
other pass effects and shared-host noise; the components do not prove causation.

## Immediate continuation

The compiler experiment has completed primary, broad correctness and all seven
held-out gates. The exact candidate is still isolated; source integration and
production adoption have not been performed.

Follow [PROFILE-NEXT.md](benchmarks/experiments/aggregate-byte-writes/PROFILE-NEXT.md):
three owned original-test executions each, with exact emitted-code capture.
Folded sampling is running as `aggregate-relocation-folded-sample-01`; token
follows only after its VM children and supervisor finish. Do not alter tests,
RNG, runtime options or source to lengthen a sample. Summarize and attribute each
profile to its own mappings/code, then choose a substantial remaining cost.

The [complete final report](results/aggregate-relocation-heldout-recovery-01/assessment.md)
independently recomputes all seven gates using the explicit Ruff retry history.
The [recovery coordinator qualification](results/aggregate-relocation-recovery-controls-02/assessment.md)
checks both original command templates, 30 invalid receipts and two monitor
lifecycle/error cases. Its first flag-suffix qualification failure is preserved.
The retry observed at least 19 GiB free; the original stop's cause is unresolved.

Five committed archive batches preserve completed public Cargo caches.
The newest preserves a debug-check target: 781,927,676 unique bytes in
237,598,021 archive bytes, with 135 external hashes verified. No installed tool,
source, result or executed artifact snapshot was retired.

Exact process identities, full tool hashes and current receipts are in
`.work/continuation-state.json`; inspect live receipts after a restart.

## Qualified runtime and limits

Current runtime source `aa2f6ea` / tool `0e94d6d8` retains resumable native calls,
persistent registers, initialized guest frames and checked bulk copies.
It passes 276 debug/release tests (one ignored), 47,004 validation commands,
245 TLS commands and 382 fre bodies (seven ignored). Its [original-baseline comparison](results/resumable-copy-original-e2e-01/assessment.md)
improves folded 21.82% and token 33.09%; both still exceed native Cargo times.
Its [seven held-outs](results/resumable-copy-heldout-recovery-01/assessment.md)
pass 588 commands, 105 pairs and 294 artifacts, within both 5% guards.
Runtime options remain explicit.

This is selected-function/body execution, not full libtest or arbitrary Rust.
Real unwinding, threads, broad OS/FFI support and fastest-available native
configuration qualification remain incomplete. No fake synchronization,
longjmp cleanup, LLVM/external guest backend or silent native fallback.
Toolchain: `nightly-2026-09-08`, rustc `cea272fa3`. The private adapter is
`.work/private/workflow-rg-aot.json`; publish aggregates only.

No subagents or independent model calls. No AWS activation or unrelated process
control. Serialize task builds/tests/benchmarks/cache work with
`.work/benchmark.lock`. Never recursively search all `.work`; preserve sources,
receipts and artifacts. Archive only reviewed, owned, completed public caches.
Do not mark the unbounded goal complete at a checkpoint.

The [full previous checkpoint](docs/history/STATE-20260911-before-compiler-cache.md)
preserves earlier experiments, parked directions, failures and source identities.
