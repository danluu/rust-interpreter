# Next work

The retained custom JIT still loses substantially to the specified native control
on the exhaustive token workflow. Repeated actual edits confirm this gap.
[Current evidence](STATUS.md), [review decisions](docs/SUGGESTIONS-REVIEW-20260910.md).

1. **Strengthen controls.** Add separately recorded native profile, jobs and test
   concurrency settings, plus a matched Cargo-check floor. Qualify the available
   linker/backend choices before including them. Repeat each real edit, balance
   mode positions, retain child CPU and host-load data, and rerun all nine
   workflows. Separate frontend/link dominated rows from material execution.
2. **Resolve artifact-history differences.** Repeated source cycles changed
   readonly data layout and embedded immediate values. Paired engines agree;
   cross-history determinism is unresolved. Trace constant identities and
   relocations before introducing a function-level cache or normalizing bytes.
3. **Reduce call transitions.** Use typed call graphs and the latest token CPU
   profile to select a bounded native call ABI experiment. Include register
   storage, frame initialization, copying, recursion, exact budgets, traps and
   TLS cleanup. A branch to a callee alone does not remove these costs.
4. **Broaden useful execution.** Add real interface/test/dependency edits and an
   unfiltered suite attempt, recording unsupported bodies explicitly. A shared
   test graph and entry descriptors may improve selection reuse; eager export
   of all bodies is not assumed to be cheaper.
5. **Revisit durable reuse.** Cache identities need compiler/target/configuration,
   layouts, stable instance IDs, semantic dependencies and relocations. Keep
   guest state fresh across runs. Measure lookup, validation and loading costs.

Before each runtime experiment, record correctness gates, target workloads and a
meaningful complete-command performance criterion. Retain all regressions and
failed qualifications. A few milliseconds on five different edits do not justify
a broad speedup claim. Small opcode tweaks are no longer the default direction.

Native tiering is a possible explicit hybrid experiment, subject to the user's
custom-backend requirement. Its policy must account for missing/stale runtime
history, whole-target native compilation and duplicate work. It cannot promise
to match native on every command. Full panic unwinding and synchronization must
preserve Rust semantics; do not implement success-returning shims or skip cleanup.

Use only owned pinned checkouts; preserve assertions and source restoration.
Serialize task measurements under the benchmark lock. Never stop unrelated host
work to improve benchmark conditions. Clean only identified completed compiler
caches after ownership/live-file/artifact checks; preserve historical evidence.
